# TQ4Q1.0: Fully charmed tetraquarks from LHC to FCC
## TetraQuarks with 4 heavy Quarks VFNS FFs

We address the formation mechanism of fully charmed tetraquark states, $T_{4c}(0^{++})$ and $T_{4c}(2^{++})$ radial resonances, via the fragmentation approximation, valid in the large transverse-momentum regime matter of our analysis. To this extent, we release a first and novel NLO FF family for "TetraQuarks with 4 heavy Quarks", named $\mbox{\tt TQ4Q1.0}$ [1]. It was built by evolving Ã  la DGLAP a quark-potential NRQCD calculation for the gluon function [2], together with a spin-physics inspired model input for the heavy-quark function [3][4]. Final $\mbox{\tt LHAPDF}$ grids (central value only) are evolved via the $\mbox{\tt APFEL++}$ library [5].
