# TQHL1.0: A high-energy QCD portal to exotic matter
## TetraQuarks with Heavy and Light flavor collinear VFNS FFs

We address the formation mechanism of a neutral heavy-light hidden-flavour tetraquark state ($X_{Q q \bar Q \bar q}$) via the fragmentation approximation, valid in the large transverse-momentum regime matter of our analysis. To this extent, we release a first and novel NLO FF set for "TetraQuarks
with Heavy and Light flavors", named TQHL1.0 [1]. It was built by evolving Ã  la DGLAP a Suzuki-like model input for the heavy-quark function [2][3]. Final LHAPDF grids (central value only) are evolved via the AFPEL library [4].

Please acknowledge primary references and, if possible, additional ones when using these FF sets!
